# Extra definitions on top of Interaction Trees

The semantics of Jasmin is defined based on
[Interaction Trees](https://github.com/DeepSpec/InteractionTrees).
The files in this directory make the bridge between this library and
the context of Jasmin. It might make sense to upstream some of these files
to the library.

The files in this directory incorporate work from the Interaction Trees
library subject to the MIT license (see [`LICENSE.itrees`](LICENSE.itrees)).
